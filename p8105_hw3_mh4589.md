Do some data cleaning. Create separate variables for year, month, and
day. Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and snowfall
are given in reasonable units. For snowfall, what are the most commonly
observed values? Why? Make a two-panel plot showing the average max
temperature in January and in July in each station across years. Is
there any observable / interpretable structure? Any outliers? Make a
two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset (note that
a scatterplot may not be the best option); and (ii) make a plot showing
the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0 and less than 100
separately by year.

The dataset NY NOAA provies information on temperature, snowfall, snow
depth and precipitation everyday starting from 1981 at different weather
stations in NY. There is extensive

There are `nrow(ny_noaa)` rows and `ncol(ny_noaa)` columns. The most
common snowfall is 0. This is because snow is commonly observed on
certain days during winter months, but not the rest of the year.

``` r
ny_noaa_df <- ny_noaa |> 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-")

snow_mode =
  ny_noaa_df |> 
  count(snow, name = "frequency") |> 
  arrange(desc(frequency)) |> 
  slice(1)
```

Make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January and
in July in each station across years.

``` r
ny_noaa_df |> 
  drop_na(tmax, tmin) |> 
  filter(month == c("01", "07")) |>
  group_by(id, year) |> 
  mutate(
    tmax = as.numeric(tmax),
    tmin = as.numeric(tmin),
    tmax = tmax/10,
    tmin = tmin/10,
    mean_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = id, y = mean_tmax, color = year)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~ month) +
  labs(
    title = "Mean Maximum Temperature Across Stations in January and July",
    x = "Station",
    y = "Mean Maximum Temperature (C)"
)
```
